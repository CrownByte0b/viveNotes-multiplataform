/**
 * The equation as a Prime Object — the Draw tab's ƒ.
 *
 * Everything here is arithmetic and serialization, which is why it runs on the JVM: the parts that
 * need a device — arming the tool, placing one, dragging its corners — are in `EquationObjectTest`.
 *
 * Two things are worth pinning hardest. **A corner drag is absolute against the geometry it started
 * from**, the contract every object on this canvas shares and the one whose breakage compounds a
 * drag's frames into each other; and **the source is what is stored**, because the whole argument for
 * an equation being data rather than a picture is that sync, export and the MCP server can read it
 * without a renderer.
