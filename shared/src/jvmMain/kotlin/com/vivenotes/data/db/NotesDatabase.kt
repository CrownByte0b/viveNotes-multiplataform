/**
 * The app's database.
 *
 * Version 1 is a consolidated baseline, not the first schema this project ever had: twenty-one
 * development migrations were collapsed into the entity definitions below once it was certain that
 * no installation outside this repository had ever run one. Nothing about the tables changed in the
 * collapse, but every earlier version is now unreachable, so a database written by a pre-baseline
 * build cannot be upgraded and has to be cleared.
 *
 * From here the ordinary rule applies: every schema change needs an explicit `Migration` registered
 * in [create], the exported schema JSON committed under `app/schemas/`, and a case in
 * `MigrationTest` proving what happens to rows that already exist. The migration's KDoc explains
 * why each column is backfilled or left null — the one-line `ALTER TABLE` never shows that.
