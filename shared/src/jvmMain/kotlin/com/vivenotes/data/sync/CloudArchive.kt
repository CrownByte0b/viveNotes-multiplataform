 * What moving a closed notebook to the cloud, or bringing it back, came to.

 * Separate from [SyncRunResult] because the two answer different questions. A sync run either
 * converged or did not, and the screen reporting it is a status line; this is a press somebody made
 * on one notebook, and every outcome below is something to say back about *that* notebook. The
 * failures that are really sync failures carry one along rather than being flattened into a string.
