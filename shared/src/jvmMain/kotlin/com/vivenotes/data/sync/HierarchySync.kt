     * server saying it has every byte this device could offer it. Deliberately the whole outbox
     * rather than the rows under this notebook: a queued `attachment` names no notebook, since its
     * id is a digest.
     *
     * What goes: `page_content`, `page_revisions`, the three ink tables, the derived handwriting
     * cache, and the `attachments` rows and files nothing else on this device reaches. What stays:
     * the notebook, its sections and its pages — [parentIsAvailable] holds back a pulled row whose
     * parent is missing and [pullIfNeeded] will not advance the cursor while anything is held, so a
     * deleted `sections` row would stop this device syncing at all, silently. The payload is
     * effectively all of the bytes anyway.
     *
     * No trigger suppression and no tombstones: the sync triggers are `AFTER INSERT`/`AFTER UPDATE`,
     * so a delete queues nothing, and a tombstone asks the server to forget a row, which is the
     * opposite of what this asks. The deletes do require [SyncDao.pruneOrphanedOutbox] in the same
     * transaction, or [snapshot] fails every push with "dirty pageContent disappeared".
     *

     *  - Purges are left to the ordinary pull. Reading from zero shows every purge the account ever
     *    recorded; this replay commits no cursor and so speaks for no window.
     *  - `applyingRemote` is set. Every write here is an insert, and inserts fire the outbox
     *    triggers, so without it this device would queue a push of what it just downloaded.

     * An `attachment` has no parent and the protocol cannot say which notebook it belongs to, so
