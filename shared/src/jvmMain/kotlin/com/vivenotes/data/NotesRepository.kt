     * Deletes something blank without keeping any of it.
     *
     * The tombstone is written already expired — `deletedAt` a full retention window in the past,

     * tombstones inside the window and never sees it; [purgeExpiredDeletions] collects tombstones
     * outside the window and takes it on the first run, which happens here before this returns; and
     * the push carries the same backdated stamp through the ordinary protocol, so other devices
     * apply a delete that is expired when it lands.
     *
     * What the server has never heard of, it is never told. The entity's queued generation is
     * dropped when there is no `sync_entity_states` row for it and the durable pending batch does
     * not name it — the second half because a serialized batch is re-sent byte for byte after a lost
     * response, and a create that lands with no delete queued behind it is a notebook that comes
     * back on the next pull. Both reads and the write sit in this transaction, and
     * `HierarchySync.loadOrCreatePendingBatch` builds a batch inside one of its own, so SQLite's
     * single writer settles the race either way.
     *
     * The subtree below needs nothing pruned by name: the purge removes the flushed row, foreign
     * keys cascade everything under it, and `pruneOrphanedOutbox` in that same transaction drops
     * whatever those rows had queued.
     *
     * When the server has acknowledged it, the tombstone stays queued and the purge steps over it,
     * so the rows survive until the delete has been delivered. It is invisible from this moment
     * either way.
