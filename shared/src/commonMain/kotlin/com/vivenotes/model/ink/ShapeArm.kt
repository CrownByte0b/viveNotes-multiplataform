 * wrong here — dragging a corner to lengthen the horizontal arm stretches the vertical one to match.
 *
 * Both ends of every arm, head and tail. Only the outer tips were draggable at first, which made the
 * corner the one point on an L that could not move, and so made a cross unreachable — a cross being
 * an L whose arms have been pulled back through their corner.
 *
 * Derived from the segments, never from the kind's ideal geometry: an arm's axis is read off its own
 * direction, so an L that has been resized, moved or arm-dragged reports arms where its arms
 * actually are. [ShapeKind.hasArms] decides whether a kind offers arms at all.
 *
 * [outward] is the sign of the direction this end lies in from the other end of the same arm. A drag
 * is clamped against it, so an arm can be shortened to [MIN_ARM_LENGTH] but never turned inside out.
