/**
 * The region a fill colour paints, or empty for a shape with no inside.
 *
 * Not the same thing as the border. A cube's twelve edges are what it is stroked along; what it
 * covers is one hexagon, and painting the edges as a path would fill three faces in three
 * overlapping passes, or nothing at all, depending on the winding rule.
 *
 * Two cases, which is the difference between a flat outline and a wireframe:
 *
 * - A closed run of segments is its own region — rectangles, ellipses, polygons. Read off the
 *   geometry, so an edited shape fills what it now looks like rather than what it was seeded as.
 * - A solid fills its silhouette, the convex hull of its vertices. Exact for all six of them, and
 *   unlike re-tracing at the current bounds it cannot drift: a cube stretched unevenly has a depth
 *   its own points still agree on.
 *
 * Everything else — a line, an arrow, an L, an L dragged out into a cross — reports nothing, which
 * makes [canFill] false and takes Fill out of the toolkit for it.
