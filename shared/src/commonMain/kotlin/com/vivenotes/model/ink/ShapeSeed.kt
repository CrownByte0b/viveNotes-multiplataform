/**
 * Turns a [ShapeKind] and the box it was dragged out in into the segments that shape starts as.
 *
 * The seam between the two halves of the geometry: [trace] answers what a shape looks like, which is
 * what a picker chip and a live drag preview need, and this answers what segments it is made of,
 * which is what the document stores and what the handles edit. Seeding runs once, at insert, which
 * is what lets a corner later be dragged somewhere no box would have put it.
 *
 * Curved shapes are seeded as arc segments rather than sampled polylines, so an ellipse arrives as
 * sixteen records instead of three hundred and stays smooth at a zoom that would show a stored
 * polyline's facets. See [ShapeSegment.bulge].
