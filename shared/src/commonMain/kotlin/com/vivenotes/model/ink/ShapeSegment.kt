/**
 * One edge of a shape.
 *
 * A shape is a list of these. They are how its geometry is stored and drawn, and in particular they
 * are what carries [hidden]: a solid's occluded edges have to be distinguishable from its visible
 * ones to be drawn dotted, and a single flattened path cannot say which is which.
 *
 * Segments are not separately editable — a shape is selected and moved whole — so nothing here
 * mutates one endpoint.
 *
 * [bulge] is the reason this stays two points rather than a polyline. It is the arc's height at its
 * midpoint, as a fraction of the chord, measured perpendicular to it: zero is a straight line, and a
 * non-zero value bows the segment into a circular arc. That keeps an ellipse sixteen records instead
 * of three hundred sampled points.
 *
 * Coordinates are page units, absolute, like every other outline coordinate.
