/**
 * One end of a shape that is a line.
 *
 * The line and the arrow are the two kinds with no inside and no box: what they are is a run from
 * one point to another, and every question you can ask of one is a question about those two points.
 * The four corner handles answer none of them — a horizontal line has no height for two of the
 * corners to pull on, and the other two stretch it along its own axis without being able to turn it.
 *
 * So a line-like kind offers two handles, one per end, each dragged freely in both directions.
 * Pulling one across the other's line turns the shape rather than resizing it, which is how a line
 * is aimed: an endpoint already carries the angle, so there is no need for a rotation anywhere.
 *
 * The sibling of [ShapeArm], and deliberately not the same thing: an arm end is pinned to its own
 * axis, while a line end is pinned to nothing, because for a line that drift is the gesture. Both
 * are absolute, so both preview per frame and commit once on the lift.
