/**
 * Whether a live preview must step aside so the exact source under it can receive the caret.
 *
 * The rule every "draw something over text that is still there" span in this editor shares —
 * an equation over `$x^2$`, or a video card over a pasted URL. It is what makes those
 * previews safe to apply automatically: the characters are never replaced, only covered.
 *
 * A collapsed caret counts as inside when it sits anywhere in `start..end` inclusive of both ends,
 * so arrowing onto either boundary reveals the source. A selection counts when it overlaps at all.
 *
 * Only ever true for a focused editor: an unfocused one has a caret position it is not showing, and
 * hiding a preview because of it would blank cards on every container but the one being typed in.
