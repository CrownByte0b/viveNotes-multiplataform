/**
 * What a fill colour paints.
 *
 * The question is "which shapes have an inside, and where is it", and every wrong answer draws
 * something rather than failing: a cube filled along its twelve edges is a self-crossing mess, an L
 * filled as if closed is a triangle nobody drew, and a fill that misses the border by a few units
 * looks like a rendering bug rather than a geometry one.
